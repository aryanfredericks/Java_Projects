# Hello Guys to my very first Java Project
In this project i have uploaded my self-made tic-tac-toe game using java
The project is made using Object Oriented Programming and invloves classes,methods.
Thank you !
Disclaimer : The program will not auto-detect if the game will end up as draw . Hence u will need to manually add the draw-ending value.
